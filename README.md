# Go
- A program which implements the game Go to be played by up to 2 players
- implements an engine to play Go

# Technologies
- C, C++, RayLib
- Zobrist hash for position comparison

# Purpose
- Educational project to get more acquianted with RayLib
- Play with combining C and C++ files (engine will be written in C++)
- practicing complex algorithms (the rules of Go)
- Learning how AI bots are trained and implemented

# Go implementation
- implements only Ko (only immediate repetition is forbidden, other repetition are permitted)

# Major challenge
- No source materials
- I need to be 100% independent (no comprehensive guides, code too complex for a chatbot)
- I will only follow the architecture of similar programs, implementing everything myself
- Not enough computational power for training
